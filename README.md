# Why I am building it

As a travel and tech enthusiast, I always found it tricky to centralize trip details, like where we’re going, who’s paying for what, where to eat, and what outfits to pack. GoTrip makes planning fun, collaborative, and unforgettable, whether you're traveling solo or with friends. And once the trip’s over, you can save and revisit all your memories in one place with your personal photo gallery.
