# Why I am building it

As a travel and techie enthusiast, I always found it hard to centralize trip information — like where we're going, who’s paying for what, where to eat, and which outfits to pack. GoTrip makes planning fun, collaborative, and unforgettable, whether you’re traveling solo or with friends.

# Challenges

Building a dynamic itinerary editor that’s flexible and user-friendly
Setting up secure file uploads to AWS S3 for the photo gallery
Ensuring seamless collaboration via trip links
Designing for both solo and group travelers

# What I am learning 

Full-stack app development (React + Node + MongoDB)
Cloud services integration (S3, APIs, CI/CD)
Authentication flows for shared trip collaboration
Writing clean, scalable backend APIs

# What’s Next

Memory video creation using uploaded images + music
Real-time group chat inside trips
Travel inspiration page with saved locations
Notification system for trip updates
